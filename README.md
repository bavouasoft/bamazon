>The app gives the user options to what they would like to do.
>The app should then prompt users with two messages.

>The first option ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.
>The second message  ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.



# Once the customer has placed the order, the application  check if your store has enough of the product to  meet the customer's request.

>If not, the app  log a phrase like Insufficient quantity!, and then prevent the order from going through.



>However, if the store does have enough of the product, i  fulfill the customer's order.

>This means updating the SQL database to reflect the remaining quantity.
>Once the update goes through, i show the customer the total cost of their purchase.
